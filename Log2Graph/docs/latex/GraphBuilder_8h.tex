\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Header file for the \doxylink{classGraphBuilder}{Graph\+Builder} class, responsible for constructing the network traffic graph. 

This file defines the {\ttfamily \doxylink{classGraphBuilder}{Graph\+Builder}} class, which form the data structures and logic for building a graph of network traffic based on Zeek logs.
