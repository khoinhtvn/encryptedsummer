# Graph-Based Unsupervised Anomaly Detection for Network Data

This project implements a graph neural network (GNN) autoencoder for unsupervised anomaly detection in network data. It processes raw network data (assumed to be generated by a separate C++ script), constructs graph representations, learns normal network patterns, and identifies anomalies based on reconstruction errors.

## Graph Input Format (.dot) and Constant Learning Features

### .dot File Format

The network traffic analysis program uses files in the `.dot` format as input to represent network graphs. The `.dot` format is a simple, readable graph description language widely supported by visualization tools and graph manipulation libraries (such as NetworkX in Python).

The general structure of a `.dot` file for this program is as follows:

```dot
digraph GraphName_update {
  "NodeID_1" [attribute1=value1, attribute2=value2, ...];
  "NodeID_2" [attribute1=value1, attribute2=value2, ...];
  "NodeID_1" -> "NodeID_2" [edge_attribute1=value1, edge_attribute2=value2, ...];
  // ... more nodes and edges ...
}
```
where nodes represent network devices and edges represent connections. The attributes of nodes and edges are flexible, nothing is hardcoded in this sense.
### Dynamic Nature of the Program and Data

The program is designed to operate on a continuous stream of .dot files. Each file represents a snapshot of the network state at a specific time or an update compared to the previous state.

This dynamic nature is crucial for Constant Learning (Online Learning). This means the anomaly detection model is not trained once on a static dataset but continuously adapts to new data arriving in the form of new .dot files. Each new graph provides information that can be used to update the model's parameters, normalization statistics (such as those for standard scaling of features), and to improve the model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior in the current network context.
## Installation

1.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

2.  **Install required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install torch torch-geometric networkx numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

## Usage

The `main.py` script is the entry point for the anomaly detection pipeline. **All configuration parameters can be specified via command-line arguments.**

The script will continuously monitor the `target_directory` for new data files, process them, update the GNN model online, detect anomalies, and log the results in the `anomaly_logs` directory. If visualization is enabled, node embeddings and node and egde features distributions will be periodically saved as PNG images in the `embeddings` directory.


To see the available command-line arguments and their descriptions, run:

```bash
python main.py --help
```

### Basic Usage Example:

To run the pipeline with default settings, simply execute:

```bash
python main.py --path <path_to_graph>
```

### Specifying Configuration via Command Line:

You can override the default configuration by providing command-line arguments. Here is a list of the available parameters:

- **`--path` / `-p` (required):**  
  Path to the directory to monitor for `.dot` graph files (e.g., `samples/big_web_enum`).
- **`--update_interval_seconds` (optional):**  
  Interval (in seconds) for graph updates and online learning
  **Default:** `30`.
- **`--export_period_updates` (optional):**  
  Number of update intervals for exporting visualization.
  **Default:** `30`.
- **`--visualization_path` (optional):**  
  Path to save embeddings and features plot.  
  If not specified, the data is not exported.
- **`--log_level` / `-l` (optional):**  
  Set the logging level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).  
  **Default:** `INFO`.
- **`--log_path` (optional):**  
  Path to save the application log file.  
  If not specified, logs will only be printed to the console.
- **`--log_max_bytes` (optional):**  
  Maximum size of the application log file before it rolls over (in bytes).  
  **Default:** `10485760` (10 MB).
- **`--log_backup_count` (optional):**  
  Number of backup application log files to keep.  
  **Default:** `5`.
- **`--model_path` (optional):**  
  Path to save the model checkpoints.  
  **Default:** `model_checkpoints`.
- **`--stats_path` (optional):**  
  Path to save training statistics.  
  **Default:** `stats`.
- **`--anomaly_path` (optional):**  
  Path to save anomaly logs.  
  **Default:** `anomaly_logs`.

### ðŸ›   Example
```bash
  python main.py \
--path <path_to_graph> \
--log_level DEBUG \
--log_path logs \
--visualization_path vis \
--update_interval_seconds 60
  ```


## Understanding the Output
### Anomaly Logs (anomaly_logs/)
Anomaly detection results are saved in JSON files. Each file contains:
- **`timestamp`:**  
  The time when the anomalies were detected.

- **`update_count`:**  
  The number of data files processed up to this point.

- **`node_anomalies`:**  
  A list of detected anomalous nodes, with details including:
  - **`node_id`:** Internal index of the anomalous node in the graph.
  - **`ip`:** IP address of the anomalous node (if available in the graph).
  - **`recon_error`:** Reconstruction error for the node's features.

- **`edge_anomalies`:**  
  A list of detected anomalous edges, with details including:
  - **`source_node_id`:** Internal index of the source node of the anomalous edge.
  - **`target_node_id`:** Internal index of the target node of the anomalous edge.
  - **`source_ip`:** IP address of the source node (if available).
  - **`target_ip`:** IP address of the target node (if available).
  - **`recon_error`:** Reconstruction error for the edge's attributes (or adjacency).

### Embedding Visualizations 

If the `--visualization_path` flag is provided the script will periodically generate 2D **t-SNE embeddings** of the node features, as well as statistical plots of nodes ad egdes features and save them as `.png`  in the specified folder.

These visualizations can help in:
- Understanding the latent space learned by the autoencoder.
- Potentially identifying clusters of normal and anomalous nodes.


### Logs (logs/)
General application logs, including information about data processing, model updates, and anomaly detection progress, are written to files in the directory specified by --log_path or printed to the console if --log_path is not provided.
## Further Development

The following are planned next steps for this project:

* **Further investigate embeddings (when normal dataset is available):** Analyze the latent space learned by the autoencoder on a dedicated "normal" dataset to better understand normal patterns and improve anomaly discrimination.
* **Adjust feature engineering:** Refine the selection and processing of input features to the GNN to ensure only the most relevant information is used.
* **Think about feature standardization/normalization:** Ensure proper scaling of input features for stable and effective model training.
